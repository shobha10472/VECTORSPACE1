            <h3>BASIS</h3>
        <br>Let V be a subspace of Rn. A basis of V is a set of vectors {v1,v2,...,vm} in V such that:<br>
         1.	V=Span{v1,v2,...,vm}, and<br>
         2.	the set {v1,v2,...,vm} is linearly independent.<br>
        In other words, if {v1,v2,...,vm} is a basis of a subspace V, then no proper subset of {v1,v2,...,vm} will span V: it is a minimal spanning set. <br>
        A basis of a vector space is a set of vectors in that space that can be used as coordinates for it. The two conditions such a set must satisfy in order to be considered a basis are<br>
        •	the set must span the vector space;<br>
        •	the set must be linearly independent.<br>
        A set that satisfies these two conditions has the property that each vector may be expressed as a finite sum of multiples of basis elements in precisely one way (up to reordering). The "multiples" of the basis elements may be thought of as the coordinates of the vector, with respect to that basis.<br>
        Bases (the plural of basis) are used to translate the language of linear algebra into the language of matrices. They are solely responsible for the connection between linear transformations and matrices, the usual interpretation of linear transformations. The properties of bases provide the framework for a variety of important properties of vector spaces and linear transformations, like dimension and rank<br>
