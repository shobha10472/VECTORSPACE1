            <h3>LINEAR INDEPENDENCE AND DEPENDENCE</h3>
             <br>A system of equations is a set of two or more equations that share variables, such as 2x−4y=5 and 3x−y=4. The simplest type of system is a system of linear equations, which means that the variables do not have any exponents. Linear dependence and Linear Dependence and Independence<br>
             independence are most commonly used for systems of linear equations.<br>
            <br>A consistent system of linear equations has one or more solutions and may either be dependent (an infinite number of solutions) or independent (exactly one solution). Thus, linearly independent vs dependent systems differ in how many solutions they have. A system with no solutions is said to be inconsistent. For any type of system, the solution(s), if any, is/are the point(s) at which the two lines intersect.<br>

                What is Linear Dependence?<br>
            <br>Linear dependence results in an infinite number of solutions because the two lines are in fact the same line. Thus, the two lines intersect at an infinite number of points because the two lines intersect at every point on the line. That may not be immediately apparent from the problem because one line's equation is typically a different version of the other line's equation. However, each equation can be algebraically manipulated to form the other one.<br>
             1.	Understand the concept of linear independence.<br>
             2.	Learn two criteria for linear independence.<br>
             3.	Understand the relationship between linear independence and pivot columns / free variables.<br>
             4.	Recipe: test if a set of vectors is linearly independent / find an equation of linear dependence.<br>
             5.	Picture: whether a set of vectors in R2 or R3 is linearly independent or not.<br>
             6.	Vocabulary words: linear dependence relation / equation of linear dependence.<br>
             7.	Essential vocabulary words: linearly independent, linearly dependent.<br>
              Sometimes the span of a set of vectors is “smaller” than you expect from the number of vectors, as in the picture below. This means that (at least) one of the vectors is redundant: it can be removed without affecting the span. In the present section, we formalize this idea in the notion of linear independence.<br>
