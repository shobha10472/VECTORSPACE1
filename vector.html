            <h3>VECTOR SPACE</h3>

        
        
      <br>Embedding signals in a vector space essentially means that we can add them up or scale<br>
      them to produce new signals.<br>
      Definition 1.1 (Vector space). A vector space consists of a set V, a scalar field that is<br>
      usually either the real or the complex numbers and two operations + and · satisfying the<br>
      following conditions.<br>
      1. For any pair of elements ~x, ~y 2 V the vector sum ~x + ~y belongs to V.<br>
      2. For any ~x 2 V and any scalar ↵, ↵ · ~x 2 V.<br>
      3. There exists a zero vector ~0 such that ~x +~0 = ~x for any ~x 2 V.<br>
      4. For any ~x 2 V there exists an additive inverse ~y such that ~x+~y = ~0, usually denoted<br>
      by ~x.<br>
      5. The vector sum is commutative and associative, i.e. for all ~x, ~y, ~z 2 V<br>
      ~x + ~y = ~y + ~x, (~x + ~y) + ~z = ~x + (~y + ~z). (1)<br>
      6. Scalar multiplication is associative, for any scalars ↵ and  and any ~x 2 V<br>
      ↵ ( · ~x)=(↵ ) · ~x. (2)<br>
      7. Scalar and vector sums are both distributive, i.e. for any scalars ↵ and  and any<br>
      ~x, ~y 2 V<br>
      (↵ + ) · ~x = ↵ · ~x +  · ~x, ↵ · (~x + ~y) = ↵ · ~x + ↵ · ~y. (3)<br>
      A subspace of a vector space V is any subset of V that is also itself a vector space.<br>
      From now on, for ease of notation we ignore the symbol for the scalar product ·, writing<br>
      ↵ · ~x as ↵ ~x.<br>
      Depending on the signal of interest, we may want to represent it as an array of real<br>
      or complex numbers, a matrix or a function. All of these mathematical objects can be<br>
      represented as vectors in a vector space.<br>
