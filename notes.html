        <h3>LINEAR SPAN</h3>
        <br>In mathematics, the linear span (also called the linear hull[1] or just span) of a set S<br>
        of elements of a vector space V<br>
        is the smallest linear subspace of V<br>
        that contains S.<br>
         It is the set of all finite linear combinations of the elements of S,[2] and the intersection of all linear subspaces that contain S<br>
         It is often denoted span(S)[3] <br> 
    Examples
The real vector space 
R
3
{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{3}} has {(−1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 1)} as a spanning set.<br> This particular spanning set is also a basis. If (−1, 0, 0) were replaced by (1, 0, 0), it would also form the canonical basis of 
R
3
{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{3}}.

Another spanning set for the same space is given by {(1, 2, 3), (0, 1, 2), (−1, 1⁄2, 3), (1, 1, 1)}, but this set is not a basis, because it is linearly dependent.<br>
The set {(1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (1, 1, 0)} is not a spanning set of 
R
3<br>
{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{3}}, since its span is the space of all vectors in 
R
3<br>
{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{3}} whose last component is zero.<br>That space is also spanned by the set {(1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0)}, as (1, 1, 0) is a linear combination of (1, 0, 0) and (0, 1, 0). Thus, the spanned space is not 
R
3<br>
.
{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{3}.} It can be identified with 
R
2<br>
{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{2}} by removing the third components equal to zero.

The empty set is a spanning set of {(0, 0, 0)}, since the empty set is a subset of all possible vector spaces in 
R
3
{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{3}}, and {(0, 0, 0)} is the intersection of all of these vector spaces.<br>
The set of monomials xn, where n is a non-negative integer, spans the space of polynomials.
