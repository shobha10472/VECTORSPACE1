                <h3>LINEAR COMBINATION</h3>

<br> linear combination is a mathematical concept used in various fields such as algebra, geometry, and vector spaces. In simple terms, a linear combination involves adding together multiple vectors (or functions, polynomials, etc.) that have been multiplied by coefficients (which are either scalars or constants).<br>
            Definition of Linear Combination<br>
            Given a set of vectors v1, v2, . . . ,vn in a vector space, a linear combination of these vectors is an expression of the form:<br>
            w = c1v1 + c2v2 + . . . + cnvn<br>
            Where c1, c2, . . . ,cn are scalars (real numbers, complex numbers, etc.).<br>
            Example of Linear Combination<br>
            Consider two vectors in R2:<br>
            v1=(12),v2=(34)v1=(12),v2=(34) <br>
            A linear combination of v1 and v2 would be:<br>

     Linearity Property

          The linearity property states that a linear combination of vectors preserves both scalar multiplication and vector addition. This means that the operations of scaling and addition can be performed in any order, and the result will be the same.<br>
          Given vectors v1, v2, . . . ,vn and scalars c1, c2, . . . ,cn, a linear combination is expressed as:<br>
          w=c1v1+c2v2+⋯+cnvnw=c1v1+c2v2+⋯+cnvnw=c1v1+c2v2+⋯+cnvnw=c1v1+c2v2+⋯+cnvn<br>
          For any scalars a and b, and vectors u and v, the linearity property can be described as:<br>
           •	a(u + v) = au + av<br>
           •	(a + b)u = au + bu<br>
          This property ensures that the structure of linear combinations is preserved under scalar multiplication and vector addition.<br>
          Commutative Property<br>
         The commutative property states that the order in which vectors are added does not affect the result. In other words, the sum of two or more vectors remains the same regardless of the order in which they are added.<br>
        
         Given vectors v1 and v2, the commutative property is expressed as:<br>
         v1 + v2 = v2 + v1<br>
         For a linear combination, this means that:<br>
        c1v1 + c2v2+ ⋯ + cnvn = any reordering of the term<br>
        This property allows flexibility in the arrangement of vectors within a linear combination without changing the outcome.<br>
